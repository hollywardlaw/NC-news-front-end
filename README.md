# NC News Front End 

This is the front end for the NC News project that I created for my final sprint at Northcoders before moving onto projects (the last phase!).

NC News is a website that allows you to view articles, topics and users. You can log into the site as a user which enables you to post a new article, post comments on articles, post new topics and vote on comments and artciles. There will also be a personal page which links you to your own articles.
